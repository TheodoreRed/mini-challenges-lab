## Features

1. **Vending Machine**:

   - Click any of the four buttons to add the item price to the total.
   - Displays the cumulative total cost of the selected items.

2. **Make Money**:

   - Input a number to select the quantity of coins you want to create.
   - Choose between Penny, Nickel, Dime, and Quarter coins.
   - Click on a coin to remove it from the container and deduct its value from the total.

3. **Light Bulb**:
   - Turn on, turn off, toggle, or end the light bulb's function.
   - The entire background also changes based on the light bulb's state.

## Project Structure

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the mini-games.
- **CSS**: Styles the elements. Includes grids for aligning items and buttons, responsive design for different devices, and backgrounds for the coin elements.
